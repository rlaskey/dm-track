DM.track is a system I created when I was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus.

It is based on the TERRAIN framework, which I created for this project.
TERRAIN requires PHP 5.4 or above. Data is stored in MariaDB. Mozilla Persona
handles authentication.

This, and TERRAIN, are licensed via the MPL v2.0 license, so please try it out
and make it your own.
