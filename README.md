DM.track is a system I created after I was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus.
It was designed to keep track of my glucose levels and insulin injections. It
is based on the CodeIgniter PHP framework, storing data in MySQL/MariaDB.
Mozilla Persona handles authentication. DM.track is released under the MPL
v2.0 license, and I hope many people get to use and develop it!
